## Milestones

- [x] Adding the schema validation to the project

Since the swagger codegen part recommended by my mentor had some issues which could not be resolved I started working on adding the schema validation to the project as well as connecting Redis to it.

## Contributions

As I said before swagger codegen has some issues and since that will be the start for the project as recommended by my mentor I dont have repo to push to thus I dont have any PR's.\
But here is what I have worked on for the second week

- Added masterData validation ie JSON schema validation to the project
- Added the Redis connectivity to the project
- Worked on generating a spring boot project using swagger codegen

## Learnings

Learned about the adding JSON schema validation to a spring boot project and use of Redis as a caching mechanism.
