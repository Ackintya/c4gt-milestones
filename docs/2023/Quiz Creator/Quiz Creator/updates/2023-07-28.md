## Learnings
- Typescript : TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, allowing developers to define explicit data types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch errors during development and provides better code documentation.

One of the key benefits of TypeScript is its ability to catch type-related errors at compile-time, improving code quality and reducing bugs in large-scale projects. Additionally, TypeScript provides advanced features such as interfaces, classes, generics, and decorators, making it a powerful choice for building complex applications.
