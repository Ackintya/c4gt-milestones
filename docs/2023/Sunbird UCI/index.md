title: Sunbird UCI
---

Sunbird UCI is created with a vision to make the conversation flow creation configurable to a level, that it can be done by program owners, without the intervention of any engineers at all. At the same time, it also envisions reducing the redundant coding required for enabling the same business logic for different channels.
