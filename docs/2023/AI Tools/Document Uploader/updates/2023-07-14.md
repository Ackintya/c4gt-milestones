## Contributions
- [Here's the link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Bg4KiNZ8pjJNm-ceb9ooiX2L0IjK-G6S?usp=sharing) to the google colab notebook used to create a benchmark for Information retrival and test it against Jugalbandi API.

## Learnings
- [Learned what Information retrival is and how to evaluate a given model.](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/information-retrieval#:~:text=What%20is%20information%20retrieval%20in,referred%20to%20as%20information%20retrieval.)
- [Learned how to compare models to select best out of them using evaluation metrics such as MRR, NDCG and more.](https://archive.pinecone.io/learn/offline-evaluation/)
