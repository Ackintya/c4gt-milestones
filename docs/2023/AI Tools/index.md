AI Toolchain is a collection of tools for quickly building and deploying machine learning models for various use cases. Currently, the toolchain includes a text translation model, and more models may be added in the future. It abstracts the dirty details of how a model works similar to Huggingface and gives a clean API that you can orchestrate at a BFF level.
