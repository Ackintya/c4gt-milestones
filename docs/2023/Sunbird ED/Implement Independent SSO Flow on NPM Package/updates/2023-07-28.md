## Milestones
#### Milestone 1: Create a Form Page with Google SSO Integration 🚀

In this milestone, you create a form page that allows users to sign in directly using Google Single Sign-On (SSO) 🔑. To achieve this, you'll need to integrate Google's authentication API into your form page 🔗. When users click on the "Sign In with Google" button, they should be redirected to Google's authentication page 🔵, and upon successful login , they will be redirected back to your form page 🔙.
#### Milestone 2: Create a Custom NPM Package and Publish it on NPM Library 📦

In this milestone, i will create a custom npm package 📦 that includes useful functionalities or components. The package could be anything from utility functions to React components or any other reusable code.
