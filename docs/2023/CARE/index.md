CARE is a centralized capacity management and patient management system which is a conglomerate of Patients, doctors, hospitals, labs, specialized treatment centres, hospital administrators, shifting control cells etc. Each hospital would have to login and update the information regarding their Assets including bed capacity, health care personnels, current patient count, status etc so that it would be easy for the district administration to get a birds eye view of the entire healthcare system as well as the patients through the smart and intuitive dashboards.
