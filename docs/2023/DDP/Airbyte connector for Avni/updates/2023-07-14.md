## Learnings

This week held a special and memorable experience for me as I had the opportunity to visit the DDP (Data Development and Product) team in person. Despite the usual remote collaboration, we were able to conduct an offline sprint, which provided a unique and valuable opportunity for face-to-face interaction, You can find my blog [here](https://projecttech4dev.org/2023/07/16/udaipur-sprint-my-first-meetup-with-team/).

This week, I accomplished a significant milestone by creating a pull request (PR) for the connector I've been working on. This PR represents a major step forward in the development process and brings the connector almost to completion.
