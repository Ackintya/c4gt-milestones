### Feedback
- Explore energy sector in deep and think from perspective of buying/selling energy just like physical goods can be consumed/stored
- DENT allows creation of energy contracts that not only enable the consumption of energy, but also the storage of energy
- Come up with use cases where a user can get discount or redeem his subscription as well.
